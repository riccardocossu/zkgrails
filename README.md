zkgrails
========

Zkgrails fork to allow running it on Grails 2.3

This version should be a drop in replacement for plugin version 2.2.7.

It is meant to be compiled with Grails version 2.2.4.

To create the package just run "grails package-plugin" as usual; it will produce a version number 2.2.7.1.
