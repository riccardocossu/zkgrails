========

Zkgrails fork to allow running it on Grails 2.3

Since ZkGrails SCM repository is not public, I have to keep each relase in a separate, unrelated branch.

So be sure to check out (depending on your needs) the following branches:

* [Release 2.1.0](https://github.com/riccardocossu/zkgrails/tree/version_2.1.0)
* [Release 2.2.0](https://github.com/riccardocossu/zkgrails/tree/release_2_2_0)
* [Release 2.2.7](https://github.com/riccardocossu/zkgrails/tree/version_2_2_7)
